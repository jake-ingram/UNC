# SLA Neuroanatomy Models

The models found in the following folders are designed for the BYU-Idaho Neuroanatomy course. Instructions for creating these models and printing them can be found in their respective directories.

## Getting started

Printer currently used for Cerebellum: Creality Ender 3

Filament currently used for Cerebellum: 3D Solutech PLA
