# Saving files from PICOM Dashboard

This instruction set explains how to export images from Picom365 and converting to a usable format for patients

## Getting started

- Ensure that PICOM Dashboard is installed on your PC. If it is not, login to picom365.com using your credentials and download the client.

- Ensure MIPAV is install on your PC. If it is not, click here for the installer file.

## Step 2: Convert files to a usable format

1. Open MIPAV
2. Drag the folder titled '0000' into the top MIPAV window
3. Click Scripts > Run Script >
